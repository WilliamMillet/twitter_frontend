Welcome to my twitter frontend clone!

I should note that this is my first full website in react, so the code is pretty terrible in most regards. It is also inconsistent as I learned better ways of doing certain things (e.g. fetching during development). A few lacking errors include responsive design being subpar in most regards. A lot of the loading and error management is not as good as I would like it to be.

If you find any issues or have questions message me on discrod at william_933

**Note for subcom markers**: I would estimate 5-15% of this protect was done using copilot.
